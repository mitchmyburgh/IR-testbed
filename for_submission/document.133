Procedural languages[edit]
Procedural programming languages are based on the concept of the unit and scope (the data viewing range of an executable code statement). A procedural program is composed of one or more units or modules, either user coded or provided in a code library; each module is composed of one or more procedures, also called a function, routine, subroutine, or method, depending on the language. Examples of procedural languages include:

Ada (multi-purpose language)
ALGOL (extremely influential language design – the second high level language compiler)
SMALL Machine Algol Like Language
Alma-0
BASIC (BASICs are innocent of most modularity in (especially) versions before about 1990)
BCPL
BLISS
Blue
C
C++ (C with objects plus much else, such as, generics through STL)
C# (similar to Java/C++)
Ceylon
ChucK (C/Java-like syntax, with new syntax elements for time and parallelism)
COBOL
Cobra
ColdFusion
Combined Programming Language (CPL)
Curl
D
DASL (partly declarative, partly imperative)
eC
ECMAScript
ActionScript
ECMAScript for XML
JavaScript (first named Mocha, then LiveScript)
JScript
Eiffel
Fortran (better modularity in later Standards)

GAUSS
Go
Harbour

Java
Groovy
Join Java
Tea
JOVIAL
Julia
Lasso
Modula-2 (fundamentally based on modules)
Mathematica

MUMPS (More modular in its first release than a language of the time should have been; The standard has become still more modular since then.)
Nemerle
Oberon and Oberon-2 (improved, smaller, faster, safer follow-ons for Modula-2)
Component Pascal
Lagoona

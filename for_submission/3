GitHub has released a graph which shows the change in the popularity of programming languages on the platform between 2008 and 2015.

GitHub is an online Git repository hosting service, which offers distributed revision control and source code management functionality using a web-based graphical interface.

Github said the ranking represents languages used in its public and private repositories.

“It should be noted that this graph represents each language’s relative popularity on GitHub. For example, Ruby on Rails has been on GitHub since 2008, which may explain Ruby’s early popularity,” the company said.

Between 2008 and 2015, GitHub gained a lot of traction in the Java community – which saw its ranking shoot up from seventh to second.

“Possible contributing factors to this growth could be the growing popularity of Android and the increasing demand for version control platforms at businesses and enterprises.”
